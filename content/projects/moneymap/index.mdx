import Phonecard from "./phonecard"

After launching an MVP version of contract management tool in early 2017 MoneyMap discovered its first growth pains. The customer flow and offered service were nice and easy to use and company got quite a few satisfied first customers, but there was nothing for them to do after they switched their energy contracts. With only gas and electricity contracts MoneyMap's best bet was these satisfied customers returning in year to use the service once again.

Of course, there were already plans for more verticals to come. One of the most demanded and financially lucrative contract type were mobile phone contracts. The agreement with external party supplying MoneyMap with contract and deal data came through and the work on mobile vertical has started.
