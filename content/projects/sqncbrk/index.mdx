By late 2018 I hade a small list of UX issues, architectural issues and just general visual improvements that I wanted to introduce to a new version of SqncBrk. It was time for a big rewrite. Firstly, I wanted to part ways with old logo and set way for new glitchy branding reflecting updated vision for the project.

<Newlogo />

New tone was set by blocky Alternate Gothic Pro that was used to typeset the logo and glitch effect used for the hover. The “Load More” button got an appropriate matching hover style.

<Loadmore />

The general layout of the page was refined and re-done with CSS grid. The asymmetrical distribution of whitespace stayed, but the proportion of it and looks on big HD screens was fine-tuned to be less awkward.
