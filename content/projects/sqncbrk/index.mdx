<Disclaimer>
  This case study describes the most recent redesign of SqncBrk. The redesign of
  2015â€“2016 is covered in a <a href="/sqncbrk-redux">separate study</a>.
</Disclaimer>

By late 2018 I hade a small list of UX issues, architectural issues and just general visual improvements that I wanted to introduce to a new version of SqncBrk. It was time for a big rewrite. Firstly, I wanted to part ways with old logo and set way for new glitchy branding reflecting updated vision for the project.

<Newlogo />

New tone was set by blocky Alternate Gothic Pro that was used to typeset the logo and glitch effect used for the hover.
