![Project “Adele” for ZenMate](./masthead.png)

In 2016 I helped ZenMate to redesign their VPN client. Internally project was dubbed “Adele”. ZenMate had apps on all the major platforms (Windows, Mac, Android, iOS and browser extensions), but they for the most part looked nothing alike.

The goal was to unify all the apps in a single style, so that the service can be positioned as a universal solution that protects all your devices. I worked in team with Jan Martin (consulting art-director) and Peter Krämer (second designer). Primarily I authored the design system and layouts for Android.
